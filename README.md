# Snake Game

The Snake Game project recreates the well-known Snake arcade game using the Turtle graphics library in Python. Players control a snake that moves around the screen and grows longer as it consumes food. The objective is to collect as much food as possible without colliding with the walls or the snake's own body.

## How to Play

1. Run the `main.py` script to start the Snake Game.
2. Use the arrow keys ("Up", "Down", "Left", "Right") to control the snake's movement.
3. Guide the snake to eat the blue food dots that appear on the screen.
4. Each time the snake consumes food, it grows longer.
5. Colliding with the walls or the snake's own body ends the game.
